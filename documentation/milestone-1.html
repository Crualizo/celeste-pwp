<h2>Purpose</h2>
<ul>
    <li>I will be creating a website for my friend, Cindy Hyatt, who is a local photographer specializing in portraits, landscapes, and night sky photography. Cindy currently has a great following on Instagram but would like to take her work to the next level. I plan to help her accomplish that by creating a beautiful site which will showcase her skills in order to attract more clients, a page where she can share her content without the distractions that come with Instagram.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Audience</h2>
<ul>
    <li>This website will be viewed by potential clients who are looking for a family or event photographer. Cindy has shot everything from graduations, weddings, headshots, local sports teams, drone photos, and landscape/night sky photography. This website will be easy to navigate for all ages to enjoy and see her work before booking an appointment.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Goal</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The goal for this project is to showcase my web development ability for my portfolio, while showcasing Cindy's beautiful photography in order to attract more clientele for her to work with. Ultimately I would like to be able to share this website with potential employers so that they can see the skills I have learned during The Deep Dive Bootcamp.</li>
</ul>
