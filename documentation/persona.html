<h1>Persona for Cindy's photography website</h1>

<h2>Name: Alissa Burke</h2>

<h3>About Alissa:</h3>
<p>Alissa's life is very busy, she works a full-time retail management position and has 3 kids all under the age of 10. Alissa considers herself to be pretty comfortable with technology and has been a long time Apple iPhone user. Currently, Alissa uses the iPhone 12 running iOS 15.7 and has the Apple watch which was given to her as a gift, so she's still in the process of getting used to the functions/features. Most of her phone usage is spent on Facebook, Instagram, Amazon, online banking, and Instacart. </p>

<h3>Attitudes and Behaviors: </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Always on the go, gets most of her news and updates from social media.</li>
        <li>Most of her free time is spent taking her kids to softball games and karate classes.</li>
        <li>Loves to do all shopping online to save time, which also includes her grocery shopping.</li>
        <li>Takes pride in her ability to combine her career with the great responsibility of raising her children.</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Frustrations</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Wishes there was more time in a day to accomplish more tasks at work and at home.</li>
        <li>Wishes she had more ways to capture special moments with her children.</li>
        <li>Her last iPhone was lost and none of her photos were backed up to iCloud.</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Goal:</h3>
    <p>Alissa's goal this school year is to have professional photos taken of her children during their softball games, karate lessons, and end of school year. She does not want to continue taking these photos with her iPhone because they sometimes come out too blurry, and she doesn't know how to use photo editors. Money is not an object as long as she can have those precious moments captured to keep forever.</p>
