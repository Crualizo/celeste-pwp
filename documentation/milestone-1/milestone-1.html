<h1>Milestone One Homepage</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The purpose of my PWP will be to a build a site for my friend, Cindy Hyatt, who is a local photographer specializing in portraits, landscapes, and night sky photography. Cindy currently has a great following on Instagram but would like to take her work to the next level. I plan to help her accomplish that by creating a beautiful site which will showcase her skills in order to attract more clients and where she can share her content without the distractions that come with Instagram.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Audience</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The target audience for this website will be people who are looking for a family or event photographer. Cindy has shot everything from graduations, weddings, headshots, local sports teams, drone photos, and has also sold some of her landscape/night sky photography. This website will be easy to navigate for all ages to see her work and get to know about Cindy before booking an appointment.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Goal</h2>
<ul>
    <li>There are two goals for this project, the first will be to showcase Cindy's beautiful photography in order to attract more clientele for her to work with, and the second will be to showcase my web development skills for my portfolio. Ultimately I would like to be able to share this website with potential employers so that they are able to see the skills I have learned during The Deep Dive Bootcamp.</li>
</ul>
